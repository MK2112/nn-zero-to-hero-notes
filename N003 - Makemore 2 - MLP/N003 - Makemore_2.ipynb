    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [last lecture](../N002%20-%20Makemore%201/N002%20-%20Makemore.ipynb), we built makemore based on a Bigram model.<br>\n",
    "Next, we rebuilt it from scratch with a small single-layer neural network.<br>\n",
    "**Both of these approaches have *serious* limitations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the predictions in both cases are based on *one single* previous character for context.<br>\n",
    "A sole character is the entire context we provide our model for predicting the respective next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And truth be told, in the end, neither of the two models we've built really produce good-looking, convincing names.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we could use *more than one* character as context for predicting the next character:<br>\n",
    "**a)** We would be able to model more informed distributions, leading to better predictions<br>\n",
    "**b)** We would have our two current approaches become *really expensive* really quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "We already noticed that the neural network (NN) approach is noticeably more flexible and more scalable than the non-learning Bigram model.<br>\n",
    "**We can improve the neural network approach further by extending the single-layer NN to become a deeper Multi-Layer Perceptron Model (MLP)**.<br>\n",
    "For the extension, we will follow the general approach from this very well-written paper: [\\[Bengio et al. 2003\\]](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)"

    "This is achieved by mapping the word to a point in a continuous, real-valued vector space.<br>\n",
    "The feature values do **not** necessarily explicitly represent individual letters or positions in the word.<br>\n",
    "Instead, they rather encode semantic and syntactic relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in the paper's *word-level* model, each input is a whole word from a vocabulary of $17,000$ entries and **not** a sequence of letters.<br>\n",
