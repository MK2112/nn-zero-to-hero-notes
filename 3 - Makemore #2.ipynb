    "With a vocabulary of $17.000$ words, the paper develops a *word-level language model*.<br>\n",
    "This differs from our own, character-level approach. We intend to keep our work character-level, but model our MLP just the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper assigns a $30$-dimensional feature vector to each input word.<br>\n",
    "A field $i$ in this vector does **not** correspond to the alphabetical index of the letter at position $i$ in the word. More on that later.<br>\n",
    "In fact, the paper inputs each word itself. A lookup table for the letter indices is responsible for the conversion. The lookup table is $17.000\\times 30$ in size. Each word (not character, but word) is an index in this table, which points to a unique $30$-dimensional vector.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/bengioetal03.PNG)<br>\n",
    "(This image is bottom-up, i.e. the input is at the bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the NN, **multiple words** are read in as input, i.e. multiple word vectors.\n",
    "> Example input: \"A dog was running in a [...]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have three words embedded into $3$ $30$-dimensional vectors. The resulting concatenation of these vectors forms the input for a fully-connected layer, activated by `tanh`, which can be chosen arbitrarily wide. (It is logically decoupled from the amount of words in the input in its own width)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then follows another layer of the fixed width of $17.000$, where `softmax` is applied. Softmax normalizes the outputs to partial probabilities over the set of possible words. In the end, the neuron with the highest assigned probability is chosen. (And backprop is then performed, if training is running). This neuron represents an index for one of the $17.000$ trained words, the word to come next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dotted lines in the image can be ignored. That is an idea that we will not consider further here.<br>\n",
    "So let's start (as with the prior makemore part) by creating the necessary data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the above, we need:\n",
    "- a lookup table for character embedding vectors\n",
    "- a fully-connected layer, tanh activated, arbitrary width\n",
    "- a fully-connected layer, softmax activated, width $17.000$\n",
